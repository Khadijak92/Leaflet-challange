# Earthquake Visualization for USGS

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) plays a vital role in providing scientific data about natural hazards, ecosystem health, climate change impacts, and Earth processes. With a mission to supply timely, relevant, and useful information, the USGS collects a massive amount of earthquake data from around the world daily. However, there's a need for a meaningful way to visualize this data to educate the public and government organizations effectively.

## Project Objective
This project aims to develop a set of tools to visualize earthquake data collected by the USGS. By creating an interactive and informative visualization, the goal is to better educate the public and government organizations about seismic activity worldwide. A successful visualization will enable users to understand the magnitude, location, and depth of earthquakes, thus raising awareness about the Earth's dynamic processes and the importance of preparedness and mitigation efforts.

## Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

## Key Features
- Interactive Map: Utilize Leaflet, a JavaScript library, to create an interactive map interface.
- Data Visualization: Plot earthquake data points on the map based on their latitude and longitude coordinates.
- Customized Markers: Customize data markers to reflect the magnitude and depth of each earthquake, providing visual cues for users.
- Popup Information: Include popups that display additional information about each earthquake when users interact with the markers.
- Legend: Create a legend to provide context for the map data, explaining marker sizes and colors.

## Data Source
The earthquake data used in this project is sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) API. The data is retrieved in GeoJSON format, which provides detailed information about each earthquake, including its magnitude, location, and depth.


## Usage
To use the visualization:

1. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
2. Explore the interactive map by zooming in and out and clicking on earthquake markers to view popup details.
3. Refer to the legend for context on marker sizes and colors.



## Conclusion
By visualizing earthquake data in an engaging and informative manner, this project will contribute to the USGS's mission of providing valuable scientific information to the public and government organizations. Through increased awareness and understanding of seismic activity, we can work towards building more resilient communities and safeguarding our planet for future generations.
